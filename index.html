                                In other words <dfn>Cappadocia</dfn> means a “place below”. The place was settled by the christians 
                                escaping from persecution of Roman Empire. Since they had to hide underground for a 
                                long period, they chiseled homes, abbeys and toilets in the soft rock. 
                                The rock settlements are made of rooms connected with narrow tunnels where only one 
                                person can pass. The most of passages are closed with stone rollers for security reasons. 
                                The Cappadocia was a perfect location for christians to hole up and thus spread their religion.
